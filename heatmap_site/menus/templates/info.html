		        <p><b>Elo</b>: The ELO rating system is used to represent the skill level of a chess player by assigning a single number to the player. The higher the number, the stronger the player is.Players rated below 1000 are considered beginners </p>
		        <p><b>ECO</b>: The Encyclopedia of CHess Openings (ECO) is a classification system for the opening moves in chess. Instead of the long names of openings, ECO uses a coding system with five main categories (A through E) each of which is divided into 100 subcategories. We have divided these openings into sections that include similar openings which populate the dropdown tables.   </p>
		        <p><b>Heatmap Types:</b> "Time spent" heatmaps display the total number of turns (amount of time) spent on a square. "Moved to" heatmaps show how many times the piece(s) of interest moved to a particular square. "Captures" heatmaps show how many times the piece(s0 of interest captured a piece on a particular square. </p>
		    <h2>Comparison Heatmaps:</h2>
		    	<p><b>Calculation Method:</b> Comparison heatmaps are generated by normalizing the counts generated by the number of moves in the games represented by each heatmap, and then subtracting the normalized counts to give a difference heatmap. Heatmap 2 is subtracted from Heatmap 1, so negative values indicate that heatmap 2 had a higher count for a particular square, and positive values indicate that heatmap 1 had a higher value. The magnitude of the difference value corresponds to the magnitude of the difference. </p>
