	        <h2>Specifications:</h2>
		        <p><b>Elo</b>: The Elo rating system is used to represent the skill level of a chess player by assigning the player a single number. The higher the number, the stronger the player is. Players rated below 1000 are generally considered beginners, players rated around 1600 are at an intermediate level, and players rated over 2500 are grandmaster strength. </p>
		        <p><b>ECO</b>: The Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (ECO) is a classification system for the opening moves in chess. Instead of the long names of openings, ECO uses a coding system with five main categories (A through E) each of which is divided into 100 subcategories. The dropdown menu we provide includes the following categories: (1) A00-A39 includes miscellaneous openings, and independent move-orders arising from 1.Nf3 (The Reti Opening), and 1.c4 (The English Opening). (2) A39-A99 includes the Old Indian defences to 1.d4, the Benoni, and the Dutch defence. (3) B00-B99 includes the Alekhine, Scandanavian, Pirc, Caro-Kann, and Sicilian defences to 1.e4. (4) C00-C19 includes the French defence to 1.e4. (5) C20-C99 includes all double kingpawn openings including the Ruy Lopez. (6) D00-D69 includes all the double queenpawn openings including the Queen's Gambit. (7) D70-D99 is the Gruenfeld defence to 1.d4. (8) E00-E99 includes most of the hypermodern defences to 1.d4, including the Nimzo-Indian, King's Indian, and Queen's Indian Defences.   </p>
		        <p><b>Heatmap Types:</b> "Time spent" heatmaps display the total number of turns (amount of time) spent on a square. "Moved to" heatmaps show how many times the piece(s) of interest moved to a particular square. "Captures" heatmaps show how many times the pieces of interest captured an opponent's piece on a particular square. </p>
		    <h2>Comparison Heatmaps:</h2>
		    	<p><b>Calculation Method:</b> Comparison heatmaps are generated from the difference of two heatmaps of the same type. First, the counts in each heatmap are normalized based on the respective number of moves used to generate each heatmap. We then take the difference of normalized counts. Heatmap 2 is subtracted from Heatmap 1, so negative values indicate that heatmap 2 had a higher count for a particular square, and positive values indicate that heatmap 1 had a higher value.  </p>
		    <h2>Statistics:</h2>
		    	<p> We provide the following additional statistics along with the generated heatmaps: (1) Percent of moves which go forward (2) Percent of moves which go to the Kingside (3) Percentage of moves which are captures (4) Percentage of capture moves which are recaptures (5) Mean magnitude of normalized differences. The time spent heatmap displays the percentage of forward moves, the moved to heatmap displays the percent of kingside moves, the captures heatmap displays the capture and recapture statistics, and the comparison heatmap displays the mean magnitude of normalized differences. </p>
